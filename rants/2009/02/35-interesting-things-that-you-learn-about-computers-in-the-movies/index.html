<ol>
<li>High tech equipment is often driven by a computer with a DOS prompt. (re: RoboCop)</li>
<li>High tech companies don't do offsite backups of the data (re: Terminator 2)</li>
<li>All media devices are readily available - ie If someone hands you a DAT tape with important data on it your PC will have a DAT drive.</li>
<li>No matter what you ask a computer to do it will respond with a percentage complete bargraph - especially when searching for data it can accurately give you the time remaining until it finds that data.</li>
<li>Data searching will always involve displaying all the searched data on the screen until a match is found - this is true of text and graphics such as fingerprints.</li>
<li>Telephone calls can be easily redirected through places all over the world, and upon a tracea globe will be displayed complete with lines travelling between each place.</li>
<li>Deleting of data always takes just a little less time than it takes the bad guys to knock down the door.</li>
<li>Alltechnology is plug and play - every computer can have any piece of technology attached.</li>
<li>High tech graphical interfaces are often driven by hundreds of keystrokes which do not appear anywhere on the screen.</li>
<li>IP addresses automatically supply the feds with the physical address (ie log on and they know where you are!)</li>
<li>Word processors never display a cursor.</li>
<li>You never have to use the spacebar when typing long sentences. Just keep hitting the keys without stopping</li>
<li>All monitors display 2 inch high letters.</li>
<li>High-tech computers, such as those used by NASA, the CIA, or some such governmental institution, have easy-to-understand graphical &gt;interfaces.</li>
<li>Those that don't will have incredibly powerful text-based command shells that can correctly understand and execute commands typed in plain English.</li>
<li>Corollary: You can gain access to any information you want by simply typing &quot;ACCESS ALL OF THE SECRET FILES&quot; on any keyboard.</li>
<li>Likewise, you can infect a computer with a destructive virus by simply typing &quot;UPLOAD VIRUS.&quot; Viruses cause temperatures in computers, &gt; &gt;just like they do in humans. After a while, smoke billows out of disk &gt;drives and monitors.</li>
<li>All computers are connected. You can access the information on the villain's desktop computer, even if it's turned off.</li>
<li>Powerful computers beep whenever you press a key or whenever the screen changes. Some computers also slow down the output on the screen so that it doesn't go faster than you can read. The *really* advanced ones also emulate the sound of a dot-matrix printer as the characters come across the screen.</li>
<li>All computer panels have thousands of volts and flash pots just underneath the surface. Malfunctions are indicated by a bright flash, a puff of smoke, a shower of sparks, and an explosion that forces you backward. (See #7, above)</li>
<li>People typing away on a computer will turn it off without saving the data.</li>
<li>A hacker can get into the most sensitive computer in the world before intermission and guess the secret password in two tries.</li>
<li>Any PERMISSION DENIED has an OVERRIDE function.</li>
<li>Complex calculations and loading of huge amounts of data will be accomplished in under three seconds. In the movies, modems transmit data at two gigabytes per second.</li>
<li>When the power plant/missile site/whatever overheats, all the control panels will explode, as will the entire building.</li>
<li>If you display a file on the screen and someone deletes the file, it also disappears from the screen. There are no ways to copy a &gt;backup file -- and there are no undelete utilities.</li>
<li>If a disk has encrypted files, you are automatically asked for a password when you try to access it.</li>
<li>No matter what kind of computer disk it is, it'll be readable by &gt;any system you put it into. All application software is usable by all &gt;computer platforms.</li>
<li>The more high-tech the equipment, the more buttons it has. However, everyone must have been highly trained, because the buttons aren't labelled.</li>
<li>Most computers, no matter how small, have reality-defying three-dimensional, real-time, photo-realistic animated graphics capability.</li>
<li>Laptops, for some strange reason, always seem to have amazing real-time video phone capabilities and the performance of a CRAY-MP.</li>
<li>Whenever a character looks at a VDU, the image is so bright that it projects itself onto his/her face.</li>
<li>Computers never crash during key, high-intensity activities. Humans operating computers never make mistakes under stress.</li>
<li>Programs are fiendishly perfect and never have bugs that slow down users.</li>
<li>Any photograph can have minute details pulled out of it. You can zoom into any picture as far as you want to.</li>
