<p>LE: Apparently the <strong>story is a bluff</strong> since this <em>SUPER SECRET WTF OMGGMG SHIT</em> discovery has been publicly known and used for <a href="https://tracker.coreboot.org/trac/coreboot/browser/trunk/LinuxBIOSv2/src/cpu/amd/model_fxx/model_fxx_init.c?rev=1657">at least 6 years now</a>(look for 0x9c5a203a at the beginning). So, El Reg, you suck for not verifying stories before publishing them. AMD Rocks!</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>According to The Register a <em>super secret</em> password protected on-chip debugger has been discovered in all AMD chips since Athlon XP. The debugger seems to be activated once a specific password value(0x9C5A203A) has been set in a certain register(EDI to be more exact, a <strong>heavily</strong> used register).</p>
<p>I can't help but wonder where exactly software security will stand on AMD CPUs, once you can access and control chip functionality by just setting a certain value in a register(free ring0 access huh?, local root?..nice, what about system?..even nicer). What about that value making it into that register by chance? Slow CPU operation? Deal with it. :-)</p>
<p>Though i am afraid my assumptions are just heuristic since one needs more details and insight into this issue before making this into a statement. Quote from Czernobyl(the discoverer):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amidst a ton of comments, I've seen some somber interrogations about security. IMO what is described herein does not pose new security problems per se; after all MSRs and Control Registers aren't accessible except from ring zero. Nor are the Host's CRs and MSRs accessible from a properly designed Virtual machine. I doubt the newly disclosed features will open security risks that were not already present due to poor OS and/or virtualization systems designs... (end of note).</p>

<p>Excerpt from <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/11/15/amd_secret_debugger/">The Register article</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A hardware hacker has discovered a secret debugging feature hidden in all AMD chips made in the past decade.</p>
<p>The password-protected debugger came as a shock to reverse-engineers who have hungered for an on-chip mechanism for performing conditional and direct-hardware breakpoint operations. Although AMD has built the firmware-controlled feature into all chips since the Athlon XP, the company kept it a closely guarded secret that was only <a href="https://www.woodmann.com/collaborative/knowledge/index.php/Super-secret_debug_capabilities_of_AMD_processors_%21">disclosed late last week</a> by a hacker who goes by the name Czernobyl.</p>
